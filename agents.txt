Best Practices for Building Agents
When building AI agents, FOLLOW THESE GUIDELINES:

1. **Start from the goal, not the steps.**  
   Describe *what* the agent needs to achieve; let the agent decide *how*.

2. **Keep each tool lightweight & single-purpose.**  
   One clear input ➜ one clear output. No monolithic “do-everything” utilities.

3. **Expose only the essentials.**  
   Minimal parameters, sane defaults, short docs. Avoid long config lists.

4. **Avoid hard-coding sequences.**  
   Don’t chain calls inside a tool. The agent orchestrates; the tool just acts.

5. **Be composable.**  
   Design tools so they can be mixed and matched in novel ways.

6. **Stay technology-agnostic.**  
   Refer to interfaces (“REST endpoint”, “SQL query”, “filesystem read”) rather than naming specific libraries unless strictly required.

7. **Return machine-friendly responses.**  
   Prefer clean JSON or plain text over verbose prose. No UI mock-ups.

8. **Favor permissions over prescriptions.**  
   Offer capabilities (“can read S3 object”, “can post Slack message”) instead of step-by-step procedures.

9. **Document tersely.**  
   Three parts per tool: *name*, *purpose*, *signature*. Keep examples short.

10. **Assume agents self-monitor.**  
    Skip elaborate error-handling inside tools; surface raw errors so the agent can react.
